# Installation
In order to build the production files from react-create-app and populate then to public, use:

```bash
./build.sh
```

. The (dirty :-)) server code is all inside `app/routes.php` file
. The react code is inside `client/src/` directory

# TO DO
- **ERROR HANDLING** both server side and client side
- Remove unused files / features inherited from react-create-app and slim-skeleton frameworks

# TO IMPROVE
- (I prefer not talking about the design :-))
